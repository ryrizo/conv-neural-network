Project 3 Proposal - Ryan Perrizo

For the final project, I would like to revisit a problem from ML310. Neural networks and convolutional neural networks have always interesting to me, but I feel I still have a level of 'black magic' when it comes to my understanding. I would like to use the CIFAR image dataset once again to train a convolutional neural network. With the time I am saving by using a pre-built dataset, I hope to try more architectures and adjustments, such as 1x1 convolutions, inception models, and implementing known architectures like AlexNet. 

To accomplish this project, I will use TensorFlow and an AWS GPU server. I hope to experiment with subsets of the data locally so I can try more models.

Goals for this project:
1) Work with tensorflow for the first time
2) Get a small enough subset of data so I can train models locally on my laptop - and have it be quick enough to try more model setups
3) Increase my understanding of Nueral Networks and Convolutions
4) Get good evaluation graphs and metrics to use for future presentations
5) Plan what I want in my report ahead of time so I am more organized when collecting results


Challenges for this project: 
1) Slow training - my strategy is to pick 3 model setups and tune the one that performs best
2) Graphs, Getting data into graphs seems difficult when I'm running all my code on a remove server.
	- Need to look into tensorboard as a possible solution
	- May just have to setup a jupyter notebook server on the AWS instance
